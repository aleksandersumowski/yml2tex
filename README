yml2tex is a simple python script which generates LaTeX code for LaTeX Beamer 
presentations out of YAML files.

Requirements
============

- Python 2.4
- PyYaml 3.07
- Pygments (Optional, for syntax highlighting)

Structure
=========

LaTeX Beamer presentations are structured in sections, subsections and frames.

    Introduction:
        About this presentation:
            Author:
                - Name
                - Age
                - Occupation
                
In the above example "Introduction" would be the title of the section, 
"About this presentation" the title of the subsection and "Author" the frame
title.

Nested Items
============

Each item in a frame can have other items associated.

    Introduction:
        About this presentation:
            Author:
                - Name
                - Age
                - Occupation:
                    - 2001 to 2009 Company A
                    - 2009 Company Z

The script doesn't limit the depth of nested items, however LaTeX Beamer does limit
it up to three.

Images
======

It's possible to create a frame with an image in it by using the "image" keyword
as an frame title.

    Features:
      Images:
        image bar:
        image foo:
            width: 10cm
            height: 30cm

In the above example, two frames will be created that include the "bar" and "foo"
image.

- Don't specify the filename extension (JPG and PNG are supported).
- Options are optional and directly passed to the \pgfimage command:
    - width
    - height
    - page
    - interpolate
    - mask
- If no options are specified, the image will be the same size as the frame.

Metadata
========

It's possible to specify metadata for the document in the YAML file itself.

- Create a "metas" at the top of the yaml file
- Possible options are:
    - title <string> If not specified, 'Example Presentation' is used.
    - author <string> If not specified, 'Arthur Koziel' is used.
    - institute <string> If not specified, nothing is used.
    - date <string> If not specified, current date is used.
    - outline <boolean> If an Outline/Table of contents should be generated. True if not specified.
    - highlight_style <string> Pygments style for code highlighting. If not specified 'default' is used.

Example:

    metas:
        title: My First Presentation
        author: Arthur Koziel
        institute: FH-Dortmund
        date: 14.11.2008
        outline: False
        highlight_style: colorful

Code Highlighting
=================

- Pygments is used to highlight code.
- Pygments is optional, if Pygments cannot be found the "listings" LaTeX 
  package is used to include code. The the will still be included but not 
  highlighted.

  Features:
      Code Highlighting:
          include foobar.py:

The above command will include and highlight the content of foobar.py.
